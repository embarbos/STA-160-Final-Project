# color-analysis-shot-marylins
Hello!

This is my final group project for my STA 160 class at UC Davis, taught by Dr. Fushing Hsieh. For this project, my group used various python data analysis methods to identify reigons of interest in the five "shot marylin" paintings by Andy Warhol. These methods include Cluster Analysis/Plots, Color Density Plots, Image Splicing, Image Compression using Singular Value Decomposition, HRC Processing, and Random Forest Classification.

I hope you enjoy!
